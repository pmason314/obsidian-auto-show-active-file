# Auto-Show Active File

Automatically reveal the currently active file in the file explorer sidebar.

## Notes
This is a fork of the [`obsidian-reveal-active-file`](https://github.com/shichongrui/obsidian-reveal-active-file) plugin.  All credit goes to the creators of that plugin.

This plugin has a few fixes and improvements:
- Keeps focus on the active file when renaming a new file
- Does not open the file explorer if it isn't already active
